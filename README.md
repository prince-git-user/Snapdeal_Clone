The Product Page, Product Details Page and the Cart Page are done by Linkan. And backend code for all products are done by Vivek.
The Header, Footer and Address page was done by Kamlesh

#challenges
We had faced a lot of issues in cloning the website. First of all connecting the backend to forntend was bit chellenging but after all going through many documentation we find the solution. We also gets so many syntax error every day, for this purpose we had two meeting session everyday where we all share our problems with each other to find solution. By this we all get idea about how much work is left and how much time we needs to give for completing the project.

#Learning

Our code writing style became cleaner as we had to think while writing code that other team member will be reading.
We had to learn about many CSS properties that we didnâ€™t know before.
